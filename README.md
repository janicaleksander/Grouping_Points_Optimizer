# Clustering Algorithm in C++

##  Overview
This project implements a clustering algorithm in C++ for grouping points based on their similarities. The algorithm does not rely on centroids but instead uses a vector representation where each point is assigned to a cluster.

##  Features
- ✅ Efficient clustering of points
- ✅ No reliance on centroids
- ✅ Optimized for performance in C++

## ⚙️ Requirements
- 🖥️ C++20 or later
- 🛠️ CMake (for building the project)


## 🚀 Installation
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clustering-algorithm.git
cd clustering-algorithm

# Build the project using CMake
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the compiled binary with an input dataset:
```sh
./clustering input.txt
```
Ensure `input.txt` contains properly formatted point data.
